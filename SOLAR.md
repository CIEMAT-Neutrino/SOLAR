# DUNE'S SOLAR NEUTRINO OSCILLATION SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

---

## Introduction

- Solar neutrinos are produced in the core of the Sun by nuclear fusion reactions.
- The neutrinos are detected on Earth by neutrino detectors such as DUNE.
- DUNE is sensitive to the neutrino energy spectrum in the range of 1-20 MeV.
- The neutrino energy spectrum is affected by neutrino oscillations.

---

## Objectives

- To determine the sensitivity of DUNE to the neutrino oscillation parameters $\Delta m^{2}_{21}$, $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$.
- To evaluate the impact of the solar neutrino flux uncertainties on the sensitivity analysis.
- To determine the sensitivity of DUNE to the neutrino oscillation parameters in the presence of systematic uncertainties.
- To evaluate the impact of the solar neutrino flux uncertainties on the sensitivity analysis in the presence of systematic uncertainties.
